### What is debounce?
***"The debounce function delays the processing of the keyup event until the user has stopped typing for a predetermined amount of time. This prevents your UI code from needing to process every event and also drastically reduces the number of API calls sent to your server."*** - short description extracted from [this amazing post about debounce in JavaScript](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/debounce-in-javascript-improve-your-applications-performance-5b01855e086).
